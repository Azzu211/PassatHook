1.2S

- This file is downloaded to **"C:\PassatHook\CS2\temp.ph"**, and it will be deleted once the cheat finishes reading the version from it.
- The cheat will compare this version, to the compiled version *(ex. compiled as 2.41A, but online it's 2.40SR, that means there is an incoming update)*, and determine if it needs to be updated or not.

## What do the letters represent?
"A" = Alpha version, may be unstable and may have bugs

"S" = Stable version

"U" = Outdated version, CS2 got an update, and the cheat doesn't work
