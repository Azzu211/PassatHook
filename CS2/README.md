# Is it undetected?
### Most likely it is, due to it being only read only, but we will never know
### Final answer: yes
# How to use?
### Press insert to close/open menu.
### Make sure your cursor is unlocked to navigate menu.
### Make sure you play in windowed/windowed fullscreen for the overlay to work
# How it works?
### It's an external aplication that reads CS2 memory.
### Uses ImGui library to draw stuff on the screen.
### It doesn't write anything to memory, any type of mouse action is done using ```mouse_event```
