# Will it be paid?
### I won't make it paid since there are probably better free cheats that do the same thing
# Where can I get it?
### Currently it's in development. Invites have been rolled out to my friends. *(for now)*
# Is it undetected?
### Most likely it is, but we will never know ¯\\(ツ)/¯
### Final answer: yes
# How it works?
### It's an external aplication that can read and write CS2 memory.
### Uses ImGui library to draw stuff on the screen.
